## Comment About Me
My name is Kendall and I am a donut aficionado.
But seriously, I am a current Masters student in the Computer Science 4+1 degree program. I am excited to take this class to further my knowledge about data science and learn the R programming language. I am planning to enroll in multiple additional ML courses, either as an Independent Study or on my own time. Upon graduation I will be moving to Boston to work as a Cyber Analytics Developer at a certain research lab at a certain institute of technology I believe you are quite familiar with. ;) 


```{r}

a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- a+b
print(c)
